# TECH EXPERIENCE SCALE

1. Computers operate through unfathomable dark wizardry. When something goes wrong with them, I need help from another person to fix the problem.
I casually use phones and computers, mostly for browsing or gaming. If my game or browser freezes up, I know a couple of tricks that I can run through to get it running again. My troubleshooting works at least 30% of the time without me needing somebody else.
2.5 - same as level 2, but I've also messed around a little bit with either programming or git.
3. I have some level of education or professional or extended hobbiest experience in computer science or IT, and am comfortable interfacing with a command line. I can do basic troubleshooting for myself that works >60% of the time
4. I regularly write scripts to automate workflows on my computer for fun OR do a similarly coding intensive activity. I've heard of Jenkins, and can troubleshoot my tech problems independently (with assistance from browsing stackoverflow) the vast majority of the time.
5. I can successfully get a printer to behave and be accessible on a private network without having to cuss it out first.
